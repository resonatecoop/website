Very excited to announce our second indie label partner – Berlin&#8217;s Stil Vor Talent.

Since it was founded in 2006, the label has had over 100 releases, comprised of numerous dance singles as well as full length albums and compilations.

<a href="http://www.stilvortalent.de/" target="_blank">Stil Vor Talent</a> is however, much more than a label, incorporating event production and their very own fashion label, which features truly original collections rather than just the standard t-shirt merchandise most labels and artists are known for:

> “It’s a lifestyle choice,” Oliver Koletzki notes with a hint of irony. &#8220;Hence, sounds lead to skirts and beats to blouses.&#8221;

Resonate is inspired to work with this local Berlin label on our upcoming streaming service, which will go into production in early 2016.

While at first glance it may not seem that the internet needs yet another streaming music offering, once the issues around fairness in royalty payments and an almost total lack of artist-fan connections within the other services, it&#8217;s clear that there is major room for improvement.

We look forward to collaborating with Stil Vor Talent in the coming year, as we develop [a unique service][1] that meets the needs (and exceeds the expectations) of indie labels, music producers and the fans that love them.
