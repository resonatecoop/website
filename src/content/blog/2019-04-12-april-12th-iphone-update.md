Have solved the main issues with iOS. Unfortunately, while the app now appears on Safari, our current audio formats are not supported.

Seems to be changes coming from the browser, as our current streaming format M4A used to perform on Safari with iOS. Short term solution is to switch to using Firefox or Brave which are both free downloads.

Safari on mac laptops continues to work, so the problem seems isolated to the iOS mobile version of Safari.

Will continue to report back here as solutions are found!
