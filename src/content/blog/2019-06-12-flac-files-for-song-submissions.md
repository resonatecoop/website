If you don&#8217;t have an existing app for converting WAV to FLAC files, <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download Audacity</a>. It&#8217;s a free, open-source audio app.

FLAC is a lossless (no compression) format that provides CD quality (great for downloads!) and is half the size of WAV files, which means faster uploads as well!
