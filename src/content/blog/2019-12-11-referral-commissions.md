Resonate is what&#8217;s known as an worker/consumer co-op.

Artists and labels earn their shares (as &#8220;workers&#8221;) by contributing their catalog. Fans (as &#8220;consumers&#8221;) **buy** their co-op membership for 5 euros.

To accelerate Resonate&#8217;s growth, we&#8217;d like to pay you **1 euro for every fan** that becomes a paid member of the co-op!

Participation is easy:

  1. Send us a request below.
  2. Add your referral codes to your promo materials.
