We think you&#8217;ll find Resonate brighter, clearer, easier to use and it&#8217;s the start of an exciting new phase for the co-operative.

This new design reflects our core philosophy:

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  Resonate is here to enable and nurture culture, not define it.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  It’s not up to us to decide how scenes and sounds grow, nor is it up to us to decide what’s “good” or what isn’t.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  Music communities have always formed organically, and we’re here to help that happen within an environment that privileges privacy and agency.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  Our brand and product design communicates our neutral stance.
</p>

This new launch is much more than just a new identity.

It also marks the beginning of a fundamental shift towards scalability and sustainability, as this event opens the third distinct stage in our collective efforts to bring a meaningful, fair-trade streaming alternative to life.

[Previously][1] we described the first two stages in Resonate’s history.

In the first stage, #stream2own was best described as a rough demo or proof of concept. Developed by volunteers and supported by modest community donations, it worked but wasn’t ready to scale up to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of members.

In the second stage of our history, Resonate received our first meaningful funding. And while this phase was [hindered by the crash][2] of the crypto market, two significant goals were accomplished &#8212; the entire rebranding and future design of the platform, plus two-thirds of the code base that would support that vision.

And although we are still looking for additional funding, this launch today creates a clear path forward. The highlights of the relaunch today are:

  * Completely new design and branding
  * A single player for the whole service
  * Phasing out code from the volunteer stage
  * Framework for future growth and development
  * [Open sourcing][3] of our <a href="https://github.com/resonatecoop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">codebase</a>

While the rebrand and certain elements of the new player are obviously refreshed, what may not be instantly apparent is how distinct this shift is behind the scenes.

This new stage marks the ability to release a series of new features and functions in relatively quick succession:

  * Embeddable players
  * New upload tool for artists
  * Shareable, curatable playlists
  * Direct linking to singles, albums, profiles
  * Meaningful community interaction
  * Mobile/desktop apps in addition to browser players

Please test it out, but do bear with us &#8212; as in all honesty, all of the bugs won’t go away immediately. In the short term, the player will continue to work better in some browsers than others. But what this launch represents is a clear path forward, to realize the features we’ve all dreamed about, while creating a framework for future growth.

As always, thank you for your support and steadfast determination to go on this journey with us!
