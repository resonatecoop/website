This fall, RChain will be bringing together network validators, dApp developers, investors, and researchers for <a href="https://developer.rchain.coop/conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RCon3</a> in Berlin. Taking place September 3-4 (invite-only) and 5-6 (public), the conference will take a look at how to work with the RChain platform, and how enthusiasts can participate in the launch of the RChain testnet.

RCon3 consists of four knowledge tracks: RChain technology, blockchain solutions, research and developing with RChain, and the conference will feature workshops across these areas.

As an RChain collaborator, Resonate has x number of tickets to give away. If you&#8217;re interested, fill out the form below.
