The short version is that it was quite eye-opening to find out how much they _loved_ Spotify. Bad assumption on my part to assume all indies are on the same side of the controversy about the streaming giant&#8217;s royalty payments. Ooops.

That led to reexamining some articles and eventually an even bigger task â€“ revising the [Resonate profit calculator][1] to not just single out Spotify, but also include references to the other big streamers.

**Was I in for a shock.**

After several days of exhaustive research I eventually gave up trying to find accurate data. Turns out I&#8217;m not the only one throwing up my hands in frustration:

  * David Byrne wrote an opinion piece in the NY Times calling for an end to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/open-the-music-industrys-black-box.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black box in streaming</a>
  * <a href="http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2016/06/01/tidal-pays-2x-better-apple-music-spotify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Music News</a> has an open call on many of their articles asking musicians to send in their royalty statements so they can aggregate data
  * one musician has taken it upon himself to create a <a href="http://musicstreamingindex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special blog</a> listing his royalty statements as they arrive

That last one has lots of useful charts, revealing how intensely complicated the issue gets. Free versus premium tiers, on-demand/interactive versus passive radio and of course the _wildly_ different rates by country.

To their credit, Spotify seems to be the only streamer that publishes their official (average) <a href="https://www.spotifyartists.com/spotify-explained/#wait-i-thought-spotify-paid-a-per-stream-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per stream rate.</a> Unfortunately, almost all stories say those rates are _much_ lower, although it&#8217;s rarely clear whether quoted amounts are minus aggregator, label or distributor fees. (See <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=181Lb8yHBgCYs4Sa6PHE_pENkc4XzIA38ffvJIOLDVXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this spreadsheet</a> for references on rates and links to news reports.)

**Of particular import** is the question of differences between indie versus major label rates. Given the fact that the majors negotiate in secret and don&#8217;t like it when <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/19/8621581/sony-music-spotify-contract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contracts are exposed,</a> there is a lot of speculation that one of the main reasons no one can get accurate data is that the streaming services can&#8217;t legally expose details because of their contracts with the majors.

We already know the majors have a special relationship with Spotify and other streamers, as pointed out by Byrne:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The labels also get money from three other sources, all of which are hidden from artists: They get advances from the streaming services, catalog service payments for old songs and equity in the streaming services themselves.
</p>

So who is to say whether that also includes preferential stream rates?

Of course, at the end of the day, all of this makes Resonate _look really good_ for we may end up being the only streamer that has the **same official rate for everyone** with absolute transparency and openness baked into the core of the system itself.

To find out how that all works, check out our [stream to own][2] page. Then share this story with a musician you know. For instead of railing against the other services for their lack of transparency, we can just **build our own.**
