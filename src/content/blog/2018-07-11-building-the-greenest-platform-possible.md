  <span class="s1">This extends from actively pursuing an <a href="https://resonate.is/in-pursuit-of-an-inclusive-platform/"><span class="s2">inclusive platform</span></a> to minimizing our environmental impact.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We’re working to offset our carbon footprint. Our servers are carbon-neutral, and we’re pleased to announce that we’re also planting trees to reduce our carbon emissions. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Some members of our core team have to fly fairly frequently, so we’ve been calculating the carbon footprint for each trip. Resonate is donating to <a href="https://edenprojects.org/"><span class="s2">Eden Reforestation Projects</span></a> to plant trees to offset it – thanks to team favorite <a href="https://beta.resonate.is/artists/1126">Fis</a> for the idea!</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Using information from the <a href="http://www.arborenvironmentalalliance.com/carbon-tree-facts.asp"><span class="s2">Arbor Environmental Alliance</span></a> (AEA), we’ve found that a single tree can absorb up to 48 pounds of carbon dioxide in one year. The absorption rate, however, does depend on several factors: type of tree, the age of the tree, nutrient content of the soil, local climate, level of precipitation, and biotic factors (e.g., insects, other flora and fauna, diseases, etc.). One hundred trees would sequester approximately 4,800 pounds of CO2 (2.18 metric tons of CO2) annually.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To figure out how many trees to plant, we calculated the following:</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Carbon footprint from our flights to date: 17.169 metric tons of CO2</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">17.169 (tons of CO2) ÷ 2.18 (tons sequestered by 100 trees) = 7.88</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">7.88 x 100 trees = 788 trees</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">788 trees x 10 cents = $78.80 </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then we doubled the donation, just in case. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That means that Resonate has planted 1,600 trees to date! ?</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We urge everyone to adopt similar practices where possible. </span>
