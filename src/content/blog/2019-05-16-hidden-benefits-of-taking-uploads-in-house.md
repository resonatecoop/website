The recent relaunch of the site and app required us to retire some legacy code, which meant several sections had to be temporarily shut down.

One of those sections included the upload tool. Turned out to be a blessing in disguise.

A few very interesting things we&#8217;ve observed is just how many artists have not documented their metadata properly. Having strong records of composer details is ESSENTIAL for artists to fully capture revenues across streaming services, whether on Resonate or elsewhere.

We&#8217;ve also brainstormed on interesting methods for promoting new releases, which are slowly getting integrated into our overall operations.

So while we know this can be tedious for our artists at times, please know we&#8217;re striving to innovate in as many different ways possible, as building a service that is both truly meaningful as well as empowering to your long-term goals is VERY important to us!
