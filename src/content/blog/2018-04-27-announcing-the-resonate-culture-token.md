<span style="font-weight: 400;">To celebrate International Workers’ Day, Resonate is pleased to announce our plans to launch the Resonate Culture Token. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the world’s first music streaming co-operative, Resonate is owned by its dedicated staff, passionate musicians and avid listeners. It’s a slight twist on the more conventional worker-consumer co-op, and a grand departure from the existing paradigm of investor-owned services that dominates the streaming market presently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were established as a co-op for a </span><a href="https://resonate.is/exploring-why-were-a-cooperative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of reasons.</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While this project has always been about supporting independent music, it goes without saying that music is powered by communities. We believe that the this model supports community in a crucial way that many other platforms fail to do. While corporations operate by wringing value out of various cultures and communities, the co-op does the opposite; it retains value, sharing it between members. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Resonate believes that the co-operative movement can reconfigure the role of workers in today’s economy, giving them agency, voices and shares in what they work so hard to create. Our new Culture Token will help us further that agenda in a number of ways.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we’re announcing our plans to launch a token in support of Resonate’s complete music ecosystem. Our long-term goal is to decentralize as many features as possible, which will allow us to continuously distribute power and control. The Resonate Culture Token system will do this through utility functions for various actions and transactions, while making sure that any attending profits are perpetually redistributed through the community. Specific information on these dynamics will follow in later documents. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The RCT is a tool that will help us give control back to artists, but it’s also a strategy for adding life to the ecosystem. The system is designed to ensure that the overall ecosystem thrives, and so all members can benefit — not just a small handful of shareholders.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Resonate Culture Token (RCT) will be key in our journey to build a platform that supports and sustains independent culture. Key milestones in the next few months include:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">June 1st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; release of the RCT whitepaper</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">June 22nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; public ERC 20 token smart contract audit</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">July 1st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; token pre-sale through RChain community</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the pre-sale, there are a few important details to note. The crypto landscape has changed dramatically since the explosion of token sales, or “ICOs,” in the last few years. Concerns over investor and consumer protection have increased, brought on by an excess of bad actors in the space. This has led the Resonate team and its advisors to embark on a cautious, considered plan for our token generation event.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to focus on building a meaningful service, rather than just fueling meaningless hype over token prices. Our values, coupled with current complexities in the crypto space, have led us to determine that the best practice will be to conduct an initial pre-sale through the RChain community. This pre-sale will meet the following terms:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone wishing to participate in the token pre-sale must either be a current RChain member, or join the RChain co-op in advance of the ____ start date</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimum $___ purchase is required</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Full KYC (know your customer) procedures</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These rules are in place to protect potential investors, while meeting the requirements of regulatory bodies around the world. While many members of the existing Resonate community may not be able to meet the minimum financial requirements of the pre-sale, three alternatives exist for acquiring the Culture Token:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Through infrastructure support to the wider independent music ecosystem</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Via exchanges where the token will be available for purchase with ETC, BTC and other currencies</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">By participating in various promotional activities and support efforts, where tokens can be earned through contribution</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">By using the Resonate service itself (e.g. uploading or listening to music through our </span><a href="https://resonate.is/music/listeners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">player)</span></a>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These applications of blockchain technology in the music industry represent uncharted territory, so it simply isn’t possible for us to think of every issue that we’re going to come across. We’re on the verge of something that is </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">completely new</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">, so we will ensure that we work through obstacles in a transparent way. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Resonate believes that the co-op model is the best possible model through which to manage a blockchain-based project. We have a great opportunity to demonstrate this in practice, but this also comes with tremendous challenges. Our team is developing a governance process that will allow the co-op to determine when the system needs to change and how. While Resonate doesn’t have all the answers, we will have a great system for figuring them out. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re thrilled about this development, and we hope you are too. Stay tuned for more updates.</span>
