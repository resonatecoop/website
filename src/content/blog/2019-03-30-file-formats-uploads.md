Resonate only takes high quality file uploads so that we may provide the best possible audio for streaming and file downloads. We&#8217;ve settled on FLAC as the best format for file delivery to Resonate.

The advantage to FLAC is that it is a compressed lossless file, so it has the same quality as WAV but is half the size, making it much faster for uploading.

Using the free audio app <a href="http://audacityteam.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audacity</a> you can easily export WAV + AIF files into FLAC.

**METADATA**

Audacity also has metadata editing:

[<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="569" height="303" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4023" src="https://resonate.is/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/metadata-fields.png" srcset="http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/metadata-fields.png 569w, http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/metadata-fields-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" />][1]

In the example above we have added **Composer** and **Album Artist** fields.

Please make sure to include those fields when uploading FLAC files, or send that info when uploading.
