In [previous][1] [posts][2] we&#8217;ve described three distinct stages that Resonate has traversed since the project began.

The first, volunteer-based stage was supported by a modest crowd campaign, resulting in the formation of the co-operative, the alpha release of our #stream2own app and enrollment of nearly 5,000 members.

The second, transitionary stage was assisted by funding from RChain, allowing many of our previous volunteers to work full-time with pay. Results included a complete rebranding and product design, completion of two-thirds of a new codebase designed to scale to hundreds of thousands of members and nearly doubling of our member base.

Now fully in our third stage, we&#8217;ve recently launched the branding designed in stage two and released a new player that is ready to scale.

With this [relaunch][3], we&#8217;re very excited about the possibilities of reaching sustainability through revenue and member growth in 2019.

Achieving this goal &#8212; where revenue supports a dedicated workforce that is able to continually release new product features &#8212; may progress swiftly, or at a snail&#8217;s pace.

The speed at which our development accelerates rests on the support of two groups of people.

## Co-op world funding and community supporter shares

The #platformcoop movement started nearly four years ago and we&#8217;re now starting to see support coming from the established co-op sector.

Concerns over the power wielded by the tech giants have gone mainstream and have now percolated into the co-op world, as the dynamics of gig economy apps and social networks are dramatically affecting workers worldwide.

Resonate was recently featured in a report by the <a href="http://resonate.is/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Platform-Coop-ICA-Strategy-Options-Discussion-Paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Co-operative Alliance</a> and contributed to the research and <a href="http://uk.coop/resources/platform-co-operatives-solving-capital-conundrum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint report</a> published by Nesta and Co-operatives UK. Resonate Founder Peter Harris also consulted with a group of German co-op banks in Berlin about their interest in this movement.

These developments all signal a shift that the established co-op world &#8212; which generates over $2 trillion in economic output worldwide &#8212; is interested in supporting the fledgling #platformcoop sector.

While we are talking to key figures and organizations, no matter what develops, it is important not to depend on a single source of outside investment. Therefore we&#8217;re reaching out to the community at this time to ask people to contribute to Resonate through [Supporter Shares][4].

These unique investment shares act effectively as loans, generating interest when the co-op is profitable, while limiting investor-class influence through maintaining the &#8220;one member, one share, one vote&#8221; principle that is the bedrock of co-ops worldwide.

While Resonate will never have access to the hundreds of millions in investor-cash that Spotify enjoys, we certainly can set our sights on a more authentic, community-driven model. (Bandcamp is a great example of a down to earth, sustainable business!)

Whether you&#8217;re financially in a position to [purchase these shares][4] or simply [buy a membership][5], we continue to be grateful for your support and dedication to make ethical streaming mainstream!
