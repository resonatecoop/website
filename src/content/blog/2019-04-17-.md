Given its alternative approach to the streaming industry, some of the earliest adopters of Resonate have been artists who themselves have pushed alternative approaches to electronic music within their communities. Here are five releases from the last few years which serve as guide points on the increasingly n-dimensional map of electronic music in a digital age. 

### bod [包家巷] &#8211; Limpid Fear</h3 [raw\_html\_snippet id="bod-embed"] <a href="https://beta.resonate.is/labels/9168" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KNIVES</a> have consistently released records that venture even further left-field than their already-adventurous parent label Planet Mu. Nicholas Zhu, aka <a href="https://beta.resonate.is/artists/9171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bod [包家巷]</a>, dives into the realm of ambient cyborg hallucinations on Limpid Fear. Given their dystopian palette, from machine-exhaust percussion to sci-fi samples, Zhu strikes a remarkably melancholic tone on this mixtape. This is in part due to the delicate autotuned voices and classical sanxian compositions which float above the smog, making this project as personal as it is fantastical. Both reflecting of China’s past and its future, Zhu’s work captures what it feels like to live in a present that seems to slip away even as it arrives. </p>
