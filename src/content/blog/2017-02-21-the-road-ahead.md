When I did a quick search for &#8220;road&#8221; on pexels.com this one really stuck out, because it pretty much sums up everything at Resonate right now.

The view from the hill speaks to taking a moment to reflect and get a bird&#8217;s eye view on where you&#8217;ve been and where you&#8217;re going.

Of course, the twists and turns expresses current events with Resonate even more. It definitely has NOT been a straight path!

By example, although the <a href="https://resonate.is/offering-new-membership-opportunities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crowd campaign</a> officially comes to an end a week from today, and in spite of falling far short of our initial goal, it&#8217;s like the song goes&#8230; _you don&#8217;t always get what you want, but you find some times, you get what you need._

## #stream2own goes live

That&#8217;s right. Even though we didn&#8217;t get anywhere _close_ to our target fundraising goal, something else **profound** happened – we recruited a developer who has been able to work full time for virtually nothing.

_The result?_

The **#stream2own player** is now being tested with backers of the campaign. A modest 70 euros spent on credits. Listeners enthusiastically testing out an _entirely new model_ for music streaming.

The player is pretty basic at the moment, but represents a strong foundation from which to build. If we&#8217;re able to keep pace with testing and new feature integrations through the next two months, we may be able to launch a public version of the app in time for May Day!

### Thanks as always&#8230;

for the tremendous support you&#8217;ve shown us over the last year. Every retweet and share has helped spread the message. While that work will always continue, technically the &#8220;crowd campaign&#8221; phase will end on the 28th of February.

Of course, if you haven&#8217;t yet participated in the campaign, for just a 5 euro membership + a 5 euro top-up you can be on the short list to test the app. Just click the big banner below to get started!

Onwards and upwards!
