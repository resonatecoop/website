The <a href="https://resonate.is/offering-new-membership-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crowd campaign</a> launched last week and, to be honest, we hit some stumbling blocks immediately.

Apart from a few device-specific bugs, the biggest feedback we got was around the language for **investor shares.**

The story about this is detailed in the video below, but just in case it needs to be said again, the answer is **no**. Investors **do not** get extra votes when they buy additional shares. What they DO get is an 8% when we make a profit.

In corporations, an investor with a 20% block of shares also enjoys 20% of the vote. Not so with Resonate or any other cooperative. Hopefully we&#8217;ve made that a lot more clear with the revisions to the <a href="https://resonate.is/offering-new-membership-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign website</a> which we posted last night.

We may continue to have a few usability bugs and of course are always eager to hear from you, either via the [contact form][1] or by <a href="http://twitter.com/resonatecoop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DM on TW.</a>

**Why the bugs?**

Because Seedbloom was built by our team to manage the campaign. The video below explains why.

Thanks for your ongoing support folks! Together we&#8217;re really going to build the next generation streaming service!
