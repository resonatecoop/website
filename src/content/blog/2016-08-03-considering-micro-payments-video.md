While our main focus is on building a wicked streaming music player, we&#8217;ve always had video in mind for our long-term strategy.

Thanks to a new partner, it&#8217;s looking like video may <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">kill</span> beat out the streaming star. Introducing <a href="https://popchest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PopChest.</a>

**PopChest** is a new micro-payments-based video streaming platform that allows producers to monetize their content more effectively than with ad-revenue-sharing schemes like YouTube.

Turns out fans are willing to pay a few cents to stream good content. And then there&#8217;s the added benefit for consumers&#8230; no annoying ads.

Not all musicians may have slick music videos to showcase, but with a little bit of creativity, a lot of ideas open up&#8230;

  * behind the scenes at the studio
  * on the road tour diaries
  * production tips + tricks
  * groupie sex tapes

Ha, just making sure you&#8217;re paying attention. Friends don&#8217;t let friends make pornos.

The point is, there are numerous options just waiting to be discovered. Head over to <a href="http://popchest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PopChest.com</a> to see what they&#8217;re offering.

(Note: once Resonate launches we&#8217;ll integrate videos on their platform directly in our app.)
