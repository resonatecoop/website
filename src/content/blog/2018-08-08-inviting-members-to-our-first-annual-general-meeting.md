<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re really excited about this milestone in our development. Annual General Meetings, or AGMs, are a key component of democratic co-operative governance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll go over our financial statements, discuss board nominations and more. Attendees will have the opportunity to vote on matters including a proposed name change, and what the criteria for Resonate membership should be. </span>

Resonate will be using our own version of Loomio (the discussion and decision-making app) to facilitate members&#8217; voting on proposals at the agenda. Members should have received a link – please sign up with the same email you used to join Resonate. If you have yet to receive a link, please reach out to members@resonate.is and let us know.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first AGM will take place on <strong>August 23rd of 2018 at Supermarkt Berlin</strong> and <strong>online via Zoom</strong>. Doors will open at <strong>18.30 CET</strong> and the meeting will begin at 19.00 CET sharp.</span>

We&#8217;ll send you details on how to access Zoom, along with a reminder next week.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As this is our very first AGM, it’s really just the beginning for our co-op. We’d like to encourage you to start actively participating now, so that we can all contribute to the exciting journey ahead. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for staying involved. We hope to see you soon!</span>

[Supermarkt Berlin][1]  
Mehringplatz 9
