So much has been happening in the last few weeks that it&#8217;s hard to keep track of who knows what about which particular development. So, in no particular order, a list of milestones for Resonate in the last few weeks:

  * Peter will be co-organizing the #MTFLab: Blockchain event at <a href="http://musictechfest.net/" target="_blank">Music Tech Fest</a> in Berlin at the end of May.
  * He also attended the Mycelia event in London where lots of ideas were discussed and prototypes built on the <a href="https://resonate.is/using-blockchains-for-metadata-and-licensing/" target="_blank">blockchain for music</a> topic.
  * Proposal went off to one of the largest associations of indie labels, hoping they&#8217;ll help spread the Resonate message of &#8220;fair trade music for all&#8221; to their network.
  * Introductions pending to the biggest digital distributor in Germany, thanks to Steffen Holly of the Fraunhofer Institute, who has now become one of our official advisors.
  * Casey Rae, CEO of the <a href="http://futureofmusic.org/" target="_blank">Future of Music Coalition</a> has joined our temporary <a href="https://resonate.is/collaborators/advisory-board/" target="_blank">advisory board</a> (the permanent board will be voted on by members after launch).
  * Planning a co-hackathon in Berlin with <a href="http://whitestone.io/" target="_blank">Whitestone</a> who is developing amazing tech for VR album art experiences.
  * Working on a &#8220;Resonate radio station&#8221; to be exclusively broadcast at <a href="http://sanktoberholz.de/" target="_blank">Cafe Oberholz</a> in Berlin.
  * Featured in Parisian street magazine [A Nous Paris][1] in the April 11th issue.

And probably quite a few other items that escape us at the moment&#8230;. check back soon for even more details!
