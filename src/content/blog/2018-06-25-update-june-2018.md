Up until recently, Resonate was entirely volunteer led. Our dedicated team is now working hard to transform our player into a truly viable service.

We’re aware that the player isn’t perfect, but we’re working on a few exciting things, such as: upgrades to navigation and general usability, a streamlined uploading system, a new membership system and more. Posts detailing these changes are forthcoming, so please keep an eye out on our <a href="https://resonate.is/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> or [newsletter.][1]

Thanks for trying out <a href="https://beta.resonate.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#stream2own beta,</a> and for being patient with us! Please bear with us as we work on these changes – we’re thrilled about Resonate’s future and we hope you are too.

We’re assembling an FAQ section, which will hopefully answer some of your questions.

If you’d like to report any bugs or ask us anything else, please do so <a href="https://resonate.is/beta-app-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>
