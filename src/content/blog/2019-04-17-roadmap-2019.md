This release marks a distinct phase shift for Resonate, replacing legacy code that was preventing us from scaling to hundreds of thousands of members, while creating a solid foundation for the months and years ahead.

This page will be updated as releases are made and new suggestions added to the list.

## Community suggestions

This list includes comments and feedback from the community, but has not been added to the roadmap or release schedule yet.

Part of being [open source][2] means that outside developers might work on these features, which means they could get integrated sooner than expected. <a href="https://github.com/resonatecoop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explore on GitHub</a>.

  * Sonos speaker integration
  * Hide track, artist or label from playlists
