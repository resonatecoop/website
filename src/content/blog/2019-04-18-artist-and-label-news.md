This is a brand new section devoted strictly to updates for artists and labels.

I&#8217;m sure many have wondered why we chose to relaunch the brand and app with a few key features (uploads, credits purchases, analytics, etc).

The answer is fairly straightforward &#8212; we had to make a break with the past and replace some code that was in danger of causing many long-term problems.

The first version of Resonate (which should have been called &#8220;alpha&#8221;) was developed mainly by one volunteer. While it gave us our first proof of concept, demonstrating that #stream2own was real and worked, the code base created could not scale to hundreds of thousands of members. We&#8217;re pretty close to crossing the 10,000 mark and really, that&#8217;s just the beginning.

So, the current dev team decided it was time to make a clean break and relaunch, even if that meant not having all of the features we consider part of a normal, functioning service. That said, we expect to roll out a lot of things quickly, so check back to this section often. We hope to surprise you!

Kind regards,  
Peter and the team
