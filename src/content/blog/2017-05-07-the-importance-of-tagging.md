Building a robust, easily searchable music application is _crazy_ complex. After all, look at all the different ways one common music genre can be tagged&#8230;

  * hip-hop
  * Hip Hop
  * hiphop

Presently in the [#stream2own app][1] there are two main ways to discover music.

The first is by searching in the artists/labels pop-out menu (look for the purple arrow on the far left).

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="263" height="161" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4191" src="https://resonate.is/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drawer-popout.png" /> 

The second main way to find music is by searching for genres:

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="419" height="135" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4164" src="https://resonate.is/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/search-genre.jpg" srcset="http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/search-genre.jpg 419w, http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/search-genre-300x97.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /> 

So it should be fairly obvious at this point that unless people know who you are – or one of your songs has been favorited a lot – that genre tags are super important.

** **

### Properly tagging your songs

And this is where genre tags go in the Song Manager&#8230;

Just click &#8216;add genre keywords&#8217; and start typing:

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="461" height="113" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4188" src="https://resonate.is/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tagging.png" srcset="http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tagging.png 461w, http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tagging-300x74.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /> 

** **

### Genre naming

If your song is &#8220;post hardcore&#8221; or &#8220;classic funk rock&#8221; in its most accurate form, then consider adding at least one top level genre to your tags as well. (Such as punk or funk in the examples.)

These top level tags can be found in your profile, in Edit Mode.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="311" height="140" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4189" src="https://resonate.is/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/genre-tags.png" srcset="http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/genre-tags.png 311w, http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/genre-tags-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /> 

If you feel like there&#8217;s a major top-level category missing from that drop down, please [let us know.][2]
