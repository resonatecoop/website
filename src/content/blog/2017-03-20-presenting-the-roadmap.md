With the commencement of the crowd campaign and release of the beta #stream2own app, plans for future development have been evolving quickly.

Let&#8217;s explore the three main areas of development and look at the list of planned features. Lines/items marked in grey have been completed.

### #stream2own app

  * <span style="color: #808080;"><strong>#stream2own methodology</strong> &#8211; system for calculating increasing micro-payments</span>
  * **artist content mgmt** &#8211; <span style="color: #808080;">multi-track uploads, playlists,</span> metadata editing
  * <span style="color: #808080;"><strong>commissions system</strong> &#8211; incentivization program to accelerate growth</span>
  * **buy now + more info** &#8211; explore content in the app
  * **search + filtering** &#8211; find content by playlists, <span style="color: #808080;">genre, artist, labels</span>
  * **embeddable players** &#8211; for artists, labels and curators
  * **special surprises** &#8211; now, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if we told ya, right?

### blockchain*

  * <span style="color: #808080;"><strong>metadata publishing</strong> &#8211; publish song info + files to the blockchain</span>
  * **permissions + access** &#8211; control who has access to files and data
  * **identity + profile mgmt** &#8211; a portable, decentralized solution
  * **total autonomy** &#8211; fully independent access/control for artists

### website

  * <span style="color: #808080;"><strong>account management</strong> &#8211; for fans, investors and everyone else</span>
  * **customizable profiles** &#8211; tools for artists to build unique profiles
  * **genre/content portals** &#8211; organize + feature content by genre
  * **marketplace integrations** &#8211; cross-promotions with third parties

And of course, this list just represents the _obvious stuff_ we&#8217;ve identified. [Resonate has evolved][1] organically and will continue to do so, creating space for new ideas and innovations to shift directions as needed.
