The first thing to know is that all music is first uploaded through artist accounts, then the songs show up in the label&#8217;s music player.

On the <a href="https://resonate.is/start/labels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">label welcome page</a> there are basically two steps for getting your content up.

  1. create your artist accounts
  2. upload or send us your files

First we start by creating the artist accounts â€“ you can <a href="https://resonate.is/start/labels/create-profiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use this form</a> to send us a list. Click the + icon to add more names. (The general turnaround time is a day or two. We&#8217;ll send you a spreadsheet with login details.)

If your label has **less than 20 tracks** you can log in to your artist accounts once we create them for you.

If your label has **more than 20 tracks** then use the form on the welcome page to send us your Dropbox or WeTransfer links. (Any other file transfer service is fine.)
