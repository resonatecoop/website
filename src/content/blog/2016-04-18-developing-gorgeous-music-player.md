Building a startup that aims to compete with other billion dollar businesses already saturating the market isn&#8217;t easy. But we&#8217;re up for the challenge!

After all, research shows there are a LOT of people that can&#8217;t afford the existing services, so our [stream to own][1] model (which is &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; instead of based on a monthly subscription) will allow many more people to join a streaming service. Best part? We pay for every play, so it&#8217;s truly fair trade music!

We&#8217;re planning a [crowd-owning campaign][2] and the first thing to prepare is a **gorgeous music player.**

Here&#8217;s a recent conversation between founder Peter Harris and our lead player designer Timoth√©e Goguely, discussing some unique features of the Resonate player:



### Interested in getting involved?

By collaborating together, we can build something amazing. It won&#8217;t have all the features of other services, but above all, it will be more BEAUTIFUL than anything else available.

The goal is to get a gorgeous player built with the following essential features, as it will become the main showcase for the crowd-owning campaign.

### Key features&#8230;

  * browse / search by genre (pop, rock, electronic&#8230; possibly subgenres if enough content)
  * browse / search by artist (see all albums)
  * browse / search by label (see all artists/albums)
  * album view
  * curated playlist view

If you&#8217;re a designer or a developer and would like to participate in building a **fair music** service, then sign up below and we&#8217;ll add you to our Slack channel as we put all the pieces together to make this vision a reality!
