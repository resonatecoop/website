Another week, another story published about the abuses of the other streaming platforms.

This one, from writer Chris Castle, is <a href="https://medium.com/@MusicTechPolicy/show-me-the-money-no-transparency-in-the-henhouse-for-the-real-black-box-at-spotify-and-youtube-4e84bff6689e#.gsmcr7fls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a story about the black box</a> – a hidden source of revenue that isn&#8217;t reaching its intended recipients – unpaid royalties for songwriters. Whether the cause is devised or simply bureaucratic sloth is impossible to know.

While the entire article revealed even more disturbing facts about the practices of these massive services, there was one casual aside that stood out:

> <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-me" data-creator-ids="9e7838b6503f">&#8220;I frequently hear from independent artists that they have no idea how their recordings are ending up on Spotify</span>&#8230;.&#8221;

On a whim I thought I&#8217;d check to see if something of _mine_ was in Spotify, totally convinced that it would be a one in a million chance.

While I&#8217;ve been a paying member for nearly a year, I never once thought to search for my own artist name, as the five or six electronica albums I&#8217;d produced had never had that much reach&#8230; never one for marketing myself, I had relied almost totally on using a personal website for distribution.

So what did I find on a search for &#8220;Dr Atomic&#8221;?

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3zxeSTgY17jHNWts8hOY6A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-545" src="https://resonate.is/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/archetype-cover.jpg" alt=" " srcset="http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/archetype-cover.jpg 300w, http://resonate.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/archetype-cover-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />An entire album</a> that I had briefly placed in iTunes around 2009, only to be removed after a year, because I was being charged more in annual fees by a digital distributor than the album was generating in sales.

What is the only logical conclusion that can be drawn? Even though I had removed the album from iTunes (paying a $30 take down fee nonetheless) the company I dealt with _held on to the content and turned it over to Spotify without my consent._

While I did honestly feel a moments elation &#8220;Wow! My music is in Spotify!&#8221; a feeling of violation soon took over. That something I had spent hundreds of hours toiling over had become just another asset to a billion-dollar corporation.

And therein lies a fundamental principle that separates Resonate from other services – we will never use an artist&#8217;s work without their consent, for the only way their music can be placed in our system is if they upload it themselves or authorize their label to do so. Why? Because all artists on our platform are automatically _co-owners in the company_ and to use their work without their knowledge would fundamentally violate those principles.

While other services continue to prove how untrustworthy they are, we&#8217;ll strive to be as transparent and fair as possible. [Want to help us build it?][1]
